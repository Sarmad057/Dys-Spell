# Dys-Spell
The Project tittle DysSpell involved development of mini games for a mobile platform to help school going dyslexics. During this project, we built three mini games under the supervision of Mr. Qasim Malik that were fun to play and at the same time were helpful for dyslexics in overcoming the difficulties they face while processing information.
